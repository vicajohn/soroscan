# Security Best Practices & Hardening Guide

This guide consolidates SoroScan's security approach across authentication, data protection, API hardening, infrastructure, and incident response.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Manage API keys with rotation and limited scopes.
- Use JWT tokens only when appropriate, and store secrets securely.
- Apply role-based access control (RBAC) for admin and ingestion operations.
- Document permission boundaries and access tiers.

## Data Protection

- Enforce TLS for all external and internal traffic.
- Protect sensitive fields at rest using environment-based encryption when required.
- Keep secrets in environment variables or a secrets manager, never in source control.
- Define data retention and privacy rules for PII and compliance-sensitive data.

## API Security

- Configure CORS to allow only trusted origins.
- Enable CSRF protection for browser-based endpoints.
- Validate and sanitize incoming request payloads.
- Prevent SQL injection by using Django ORM and parameterized queries.
- Apply rate limiting and DDoS protections on public endpoints.
- Version APIs and include deprecation guidance for breaking changes.

## Dependency Security

- Scan dependencies regularly for vulnerabilities.
- Use automated tools to identify supply-chain risks.
- Keep dependencies up to date and apply security patches promptly.

## Infrastructure Security

- Harden network boundaries with firewalls and Kubernetes network policies.
- Scan container images for known vulnerabilities.
- Use secure secret management in Kubernetes and deployment pipelines.

## Vulnerability Management

- Maintain a vulnerability disclosure policy.
- Define a clear bug reporting and triage process.
- Apply security patches and track remediation progress.

## Incident Response

- Establish incident detection and alerting procedures.
- Define an incident response playbook with roles and communication channels.
- Conduct blameless post-incident reviews and update documentation.

## References

- Align guidance with OWASP Top 10 where applicable.
- Include security checklist items for deployment and operations.
