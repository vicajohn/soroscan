# API Overview

SoroScan provides a dual-interface API to interact with indexed Soroban data. You can use our REST API for standard CRUD operations and our GraphQL API for complex, deeply nested queries.

## REST API

The REST API is ideal for simple integrations, managing webhooks, and retrieving specific contract details.

### Base URL
```
https://api.soroscan.io/api/ingest/
```

### Authentication
Most endpoints require an API Key passed in the `Authorization` header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

### Core Resources
- **Contracts**: `/contracts/` — List and manage tracked contracts.
- **Events**: `/events/` — Query contract events with filtering metadata.
- **Webhooks**: `/webhooks/` — Subscribe to real-time event notifications.

---

## GraphQL API

For more advanced use cases, our GraphQL API allows you to fetch exactly the data you need in a single request.

### Endpoint
```
https://api.soroscan.io/graphql/
```

### Sample Query
```graphql
query GetContractWithEvents($id: String!) {
  contract(id: $id) {
    name
    description
    events(first: 10) {
      edges {
        node {
          eventType
          ledger
          txHash
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
