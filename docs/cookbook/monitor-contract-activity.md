# Monitor Contract Activity

## Goal
Get aggregated statistics about a contract, such as total events, unique event types, and last activity ledger.

## Prerequisites
- The contract must be actively tracked by SoroScan.

## Code
```typescript
import { SoroScanClient } from '@soroscan/sdk';

const client = new SoroScanClient({ apiKey: 'your_api_key' });
const stats = await client.getContractStats('CCAAA...');
console.log(`Total Events: ${stats.total_events}, Last Ledger: ${stats.latest_ledger}`);
```

## Expected Output
```json
{
  "total_events": 45000,
  "unique_event_types": 4,
  "latest_ledger": 1234567,
  "last_activity": "2024-05-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Error Handling
If the contract has no events yet, the stats might return `0` for counts and `null` for the latest ledger. Check for nullability in your app logic.
