# Setup Webhook

## Goal
Register a webhook endpoint to receive HTTP POST requests whenever a contract emits a specific event.

## Prerequisites
- A publicly accessible HTTP endpoint to receive POST requests.
- SoroScan API key.

## Code
```typescript
import { SoroScanClient } from '@soroscan/sdk';

const client = new SoroScanClient({ apiKey: 'your_api_key' });
const webhook = await client.createWebhook({
  target_url: 'https://myapp.com/webhooks/soroban',
  contract_id: 'CCAAA...',
  event_types: ['transfer', 'mint']
});
console.log(`Webhook created! Secret: ${webhook.secret}`);
```

## Expected Output
```json
{
  "id": 12,
  "target_url": "https://myapp.com/webhooks/soroban",
  "secret": "wh_sec_xyz123...",
  "status": "active"
}
```

## Error Handling
Ensure your `target_url` responds with a `200 OK` within 5 seconds, otherwise the delivery will be marked as failed and eventually disabled after multiple retries.
